Individual tile content files (one of each type) for testing the `updateAlignment` 
command. These have been taken from the state at 
https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/blob/83306253e36bbc3fb53801fdae8dee62f1a47be5
which was before the alignment of the spec data was fixed via
https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/commit/4b3b4186b4afa2307d7d1666569826d864b984ca

The `testComposite.cmpt` was created specifically for this test,
from `batchedColors.b3dm` and `pointCloudRGB.pnts`.
