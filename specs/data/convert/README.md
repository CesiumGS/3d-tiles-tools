Test tilesets for the `convert` command.

These files are intended for testing the handling of the 'default' tileset JSON file
when using the `convert` command to convert from directories or ZIP files to 
tileset package files: Tileset package files (`.3tz` and `.3dtiles`) generally 
require a `tileset.json` file to be present as the "top-level" tileset JSON. 

The `basic` directory and `basic.zip` file contain a `tileset.json` and a `tilesetA.json`.
The `ambiguous` directory and `ambiguous.zip` file contain a `tilesetA.json` and a `tilesetB.json`.
